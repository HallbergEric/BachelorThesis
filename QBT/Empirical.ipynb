As convenient as it is should I just stick with EC2 for my needs?\\nThanks for reading &lt;3\\n\n",

Cloudfront routes to the Lambda function through API gateway.\\nThe Lambda function operates within the VPC so it can write to Amazon RDS.\\nWe want to implement the server side ReCaptcha V3 check within our Lambda function but as Lambdas within a VPC do not have external internet access, the call to validate with Google times out.\\nI've read we can overcome this with setting up a NAT gateway but running a gateway continuously is a cost we would like to defer for the moment if we can.\\nI have thought of the following options:\\n\\nCreate a non vpc lambda function to validate the ReCaptcha token. Call this from the VPC lambda function. Will this work?\\nAs we are using CloudFront, create a Lambda@Edge function to validate the ReCaptcha token. If the validation passes, route to the VPC lambda function as normal. If the validation fails, return a response directly error to the client.\\nUse SES. Ideally we wanted a synchronous response (i.e. any errors are responded to the client). This would be a bit more work but my only query would be can you write to a SES queue from a non VPC lambda function?\\n\\nAny pointers or any other options would be much appreciated.\\n\n",

I also created a CloudWatch event to trigger the function every hour of the day. This works well for a few volumes, but with additions of volumes, this causes cost / speed issues.\\nQuestion: I am trying to update my EBS Snapshot Deletion lambda function code to  find the rate limit of requests to avoid throttling, and use that to create an exponential backoff/retry model for the program(making the program scalable no matter how many snapshots there are). I would assume there is a special API call that can help me with this, but I have not been able to find any concrete information online. Any help would be much appreciated!

Is there any benefit to using a DynamoDB trigger in this case instead of invoking the second Lambda using the first one? \\nIt looks like the programmatic invocation would give me more control over when the Lambda is called (ie. I could wait for several updates to occur before calling), and reading from a DynamoDB Stream costs money while simply invoking the Lambda does not. \\nSo, is there a benefit to using a trigger here? Or would I be better off invoking the Lambda myself?\\n\n",

But i don't know which pixels will be needed.)\\nThe result of the lambda will be persisted so that the image operation is only done once per pixel.\\nMy main concern is that i would like to avoid large unnecessary processing time and costs. I expect multiple calls per second of the lambda. The naive way would be to throw the image into an s3 bucket, then read it in the lambda to get one pixel - but i would think that then each lambda invoke would become very heavy. I could do some custom solution such as storing the rows separately but was wondering if there is some set of technologies that handles it more elegant.\\nRight now i am using Node.js 14.x but that's not a strong requirement.\\nthe image is in tif format but i could convert it to another image format beforehand if needed. (just not to the answer of the lambda as that is even bigger)\\nHow can i efficiently design this lambda?\\n\n",

The AWS Comprehend endpoint has a rate limit which goes up and down throughout the day based off something I can control. The fastest way to process my data, which also optimizes the costs I am paying for the AWS Comprehend endpoint to be up, is to set concurrency high enough that I get throttling errors returned from the api. This however comes with the caveat, that I am paying for more AWS Lambda invocations, the flip side being, that to optimize the costs I am paying for AWS Lambda, I want 0 throttling errors.\\nIs it possible to set up autoscaling for the concurrency limit of the lambda such that it will increase if it isn't getting any throttling errors, but decrease if it is getting too many?\\n\n",

Can the code be cut short or can the execution time be decreased in some way?\\n\\nUPDATE 1\\nAs suggested by , I added regions to an array. It looks more cleaner now. but still it contains few loops which can be eliminated. Like: to return callback, condition is checked whether all regions are executed or not, if callback is kept outside loop, it will return null response, as asynchronous Node will execute it first. Promises can be used to overcome that situation, but still not sure how to use promises when loops are nested and execution time is a concern. Also, can there be a way other than promises this can be done without adding more cost in execution?\\n\\n\n",

After some research,  I found that we need to keep the lambda under the same VPC as aurora serverless. But keeping lambda in VPC leads to increase the cold start and also in order to access the internet we need to use NAT gateway which leads to additional cost. Since our application is small we cannot afford additional cost. Is there any other way we can access the aurora serverless database without keeping the lambda function in vpc?\\n\n",

AWS seems to call their services by different names when it comes to passing them in as variables in boto methods. Is there a list of what their services are called when you need to pass them in as Boto variables? For example, to get a response from EC2 I need to write 'Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud - Compute', but for Lambda, I need to write 'AWS Lambda'. There seems to be no pattern.\\nFor example, I get a response for all the services below except 'Amazon CodeBuild' and 'AWS Code Pipeline - Service'. It has been trial and error so far trying to get the names right, and have only found a few random examples in the docs.\\n\\n\n",

For example:\\n\\nAny ideas how to avoid this delay? There are no other batch operations happening on the account and priority is set to \"10\". Maybe it has something to do with the reserved concurrency value? Although according to the :\\n\\nWhen the job runs, Amazon S3 starts multiple function instances to process the Amazon S3 objects in parallel, up to the concurrency limit of the function. Amazon S3 limits the initial ramp-up of instances to avoid excess cost for smaller jobs.\\n\\nThank you\\n\n",

The only way I can think of - is to make copies of every lambda function, every database, every EC2 instance, every API and bucket....

      "2006     I have an interesting real-life situation:\\n\\nI have a huge SQS (with really plenty of messages, constantly refilling (worst-case scenario, 50 messages per second);\\nA Lambda that will consume SQS and push them to an external database (the database will process the messages in a sync way, unfortunately).\\n\\nConstraints:\\n\\nThe final external database shouldn't process data continuously but needs some idle time. This is due to the database activity costs (cost per CPU usage);\\nSQS is already part of the architecture;\\nthe final external database is not in my control.\\n\\nHere are my solutions, concerns and questions:\\n\\nSol 1: Using Cloudwatch to schedule the Lambda every hour to give time to consume part of the queue and then leaving the final DB idle for a bit.\\n\\nIssue: the queue could \"explode\" meaning it could fill really quickly and the processing would be slow.\\n\\nSol 2: Create a Lambda (A) triggered by Cloudwatch every X time. This Lambda would cycle 10 times and trigger another Lambda (B) that would consume 10 messages (max of msgs per \"time?\" in SQS) and should autoscale as well.\\n\\nIssue: Not sure about the autoscaling criteria... it looks more fantasy.\\n\\nSol 3 (bonus): Create a second SQS (2). An intermediate Lambda (I) will be triggered every X time and move the messages from SQS (1) to SQS (2). There is an event on SQS (2) that will trigger a Lambda (2) and this will autoscale.\\n\\nIssue: too messy, overcomplicated, tied to the number of messages moved from SQS (1) to SQS (2).\\nNow\\nNow, it is clear my concern is related to the Lambda autoscaling in consuming SQS and feeding the database.\\nAlso, the Lambda should scale enough to consume a good amount of SQS messages but, at the same time, should leave some idle time to the final database.\\nI hope I've explained the situation well and would be happy to have your advice on that (happy to learn!).\\nThanks,\\nMauro\\n\n",

I'd like to archive every incoming blob (after some basic authentication and validation of course). What are your recommendations on how to do this?\\nAdditional info:\\n\\nI'm using AWS Lambda reduce cost.\\nThe archives will be accessed very infrequently, so I've been eyeballing S3 Glacier to reduce pricing. My issue is I need to figure out how to do batching of blobs per S3 file to avoid the overhead of many files.\\nAlternative storage services that I've been looking at are Cloudwatch logs and DynamoDB.\\n\\n\n",

      "15670    The thing what i want do:\\nI'm thinking about use aws dynamodb as my new web site(press and bbs mixed type) main server.\\nBut I can't design database, because dynamodb maybe cannot satisfy my requirements.\\nSomebody knows how can i do?\\nFoundation\\nMy boss's plan is spawning many websites and close it several days after if it's traffic is low. (and go on until it success)\\nHe has many domain names (over hundreads) and want make many websites.\\nAnd he also wants selling our system for web solution to customers. ( internet newspaper, blogs, magazines, etc... )\\nIt is very large plan, anyway i must design the system.  \\nSituation\\nfirst, most of website is going trashcan after several days.\\nso make each websites on on-premise server is not good way because it means too much manual-jobs. (just deploying the site, undeploying the site)\\nAnd also on-premised pricing is not good in this case because we can't predict any webserver is closing (because traffic size lower than survive-line), or survive because traffic is grow faster.\\ni guess 80% of sites are just ghost sites.  \\nsecond, the amount of spawining websites are not measurable. Because my boss always yelled me 'as many as can!'  \\nAnd I also consider about this project is abandoned by my company after launching some month after. (maybe they want keep-and-not-maintain mode with not consume many price)   \\nAnyway, ths problem is the...\\n1. can't predict how many sites are alive and gets high traffic.\\n2. can't predict how many sites are ghosts or few traffics (under 1000users/days).\\n3. even the project is abandoned, the'll want keep-and-not-maintain-mode (with lowcost as they can)\\nconslusion is\\n1. most sites are going to keep-and-not-maintain-mode. it's cost must low\\n2. some few sites are 'burst' in after times. it must support this situation also.  \\nSo next is my answer:\\nServer : full faas serverless with stateless server (lambda, cloudrun, function, etc... i think cloudrun is best because development is very it can easy using my own docker)\\nthe reason is...\\nif this website is 'just keep and not maintain it', we did not pay for it. or very small price.\\nif the site growing up or traffic is burst, it can support on-live.  \\nDatabase : serverless because it's traffic is not measurable in this stage.\\nthere only two serverless (means needs no pay for provisioned instance). Aurora and Dynamodb.  \\nAurora is my first choice because I always using mysql or mariadb in webservice.\\nBut there is two problem.\\nAurora serverless is too sensitive acu scaling. and it never going scale-down until 5 minutes flowed. (and if it scaled up to 4 acu, 5*4=20acu/min. just one connection and query once, but pricing=$0.03)\\nIt is pretty sure if one of these site's traffic is changed from 'nobody use it' to 'a few people comes', Autoscale price is going to very higher. even i set max acu scale limit to 1, there are another problems. (well-known problems). If aurora start from cold, it takes very long time(about 30seconds). And if it is scaling, it also takes some delay.\\nAnyway, i can't make good pricing design for Aurora.  \\nSo I moved on Dynamodb.\\nIt has very good pricing rules. In on-demand mode, under $2 per 1,000,000 rcu.\\nI guess most of site data is stored in S3. So read/write other data is not much than 1kb/4kb, and even i transaction for each unit, under $2 per 500,000rcu.  \\nActual Problem\\nBut it has trap point.\\nIf I do scan, its pricing is going to very higher. because returns a lot of data (until 1mb). I accepted. So I must using query. But query is working same as 'scan in a partition'. And pricing is going to scanned amount of read-write-units(until 1mb). So if I have 100 items in a key and query just one item (total 100 members and just select one of that members), the dynamodb charges 100 times pricing because it scanned 100 items. (assume each item lower than 1kb). I cant believe it. (x100 pricing) so googled it.\\nI found many people are design dynamodb seperated hash-key. (like 'members-startfrom-a', 'members-startfrom-b', ... )\\nQuestion\\nIs it normal?\\nIn this time, I think dynamodb cannot support normal website (bbs or press, or blog). because they are rdb optimized structures. Even paging articles needs full-scan(or partitioned full-scan).  Is it right? or there is a 'migration rules' for rdb user to dynamodb user?\\nSomeone can show me 'case-study'?\\nMost case people use dynamodb as subdb.  \\n\n",

In generated html we have few static assets (like images, stylesheets etc.).\\nWhy should I (or not) choose S3 over Lambda to serve this content?\\nHere are pros &amp; cons which I see:\\nPerformance\\nI was quite sure that providing content from S3 is much more faster then from Lambda (there is no script which need to be executed)...\\n...Until I performed some tests (file size ~44kB) average of 10 requests:\\n\\nAPI GW + S3: 285ms\\nAPI GW + Lambda: 290ms\\nS3: 135ms\\n\\nAs you can see there is no difference between providing content from Lambda via API GW then from S3. The only significant difference is between direct link to s3 and two previous tests.\\nLambda 1 : S3 1\\nCost\\nAnd here Lambda wins definetely.\\nFirst of all we have free triage of 1 000 000 requests,\\nSecond here pricing comes:\\n\\nS3: $0.004 per 10,000 requests\\nLambda: around 0,002000624 per 10,000 requests:\\n\\n($0.20 per 1 million requests + $0.000000208$ per every 100ms)\\nSo in pricing Lambda wins.\\nSummarizing\\nMy observations shows that Lambda is better way to serve even static content (speed is similar to S3, and pricing is twice cheaper).\\nIs there anything what I am missing?\\n\n",

Suppose the request is served in 200ms.\\nObviously the Lambda with the wsgi server inside continues running (Zappa by default makes the lambda run for at least 30s).\\nSo now to the various subquestions:\\n\\nHow much time am I charged for the execution?\\n\\n200ms because of the request duration\\n30s because of the below limit for my lambda execution time\\nuntil the lambda is killed by AWS to reclaim space (which could occur even 30-45 minutes after)\\n\\nIf another request come along (and the first one is still being served) will the second request spin up another Lambda container or it will be queued until a threshold time has passed?\\n\\nI expected to be charged just for the 200ms by reading AWS Lambda pricing page, but I would bet on it charging for 30s because, after all, I'm the one who imposed such limit.\\nIn case I'm just charged for 200ms (and subsequent requests time) but the container keeps running uninterruptly for 30-45 minutes, I have a third subquestion:\\n\\nSuppose now that I want to use a global variable as a simple local cache and synchronize it with a database (let's say DynamoDB) before the container is killed.\\nTo do this I would like to raise the execution time limit of my lambdas to 15m, then at lambda creation set a Timer to fire a function that synchronizes the state and aborts the function after 14m30s.\\nHow would accounted running time change in this settings (i.e. with a Timer that fires after a certain amount of time)?\\n\\nThe proposed lambda code for this subquestion is:\\n\\nThanks in advance for any information.\\n\n",

Probably not.\\nIf it's not free, then how 30 events per month will be billed if pricing is based on million of events.\\nGoogling didn't help. Do you have ideas how 30 events will be billed?\\n\\nUpdate:\\nWhile experimenting I found that we should not pay for 30 events per months but it's not clear why. Probably less than million of events are free.\\n\n",

(Most of the time the data might not even be changed at all but when it is changed I want to be notified it immediately).\\nAn important clarification is that my app sits outsite of AWS, and only access the AWS dynamodb to get data (using simple http request built with c#).\\nIs there any way I can get a notification to my app when a new data is inserted into dynamodb? \\n\n",

So, I found another called . \\nBelow is Auth0 to restrict our custom access api\\n\\nCurrently, I am trying to restrict access API using AWS cognito, but I am not finding correct documentation to achieve this. Can anyone please tell me whether restricting api access can be possible using aws cognito.\\n\n",

I'd like to archive every incoming blob (after some basic authentication and validation of course). What are your recommendations on how to do this?\\nAdditional info:\\n\\nI'm using AWS Lambda reduce cost.\\nThe archives will be accessed very infrequently, so I've been eyeballing S3 Glacier to reduce pricing. My issue is I need to figure out how to do batching of blobs per S3 file to avoid the overhead of many files.\\nAlternative storage services that I've been looking at are Cloudwatch logs and DynamoDB.\\n\\n\n",

Currently we are on the edge to start developing a SaaS webApp using java or springboot &amp; we want to leverage AWS lambda for pricing sake but couple things I couldn't understand and couldn't find good example are:\\n\\nIs it feasible to develop web app fully on AWS lambda using JAVA or springboot?(I\\nknow we can write java function on lambda).\\nHow do we tackle code reusability on AWS Lambda?\\nIf we end up having 100 lambda functions, does it mean we need to build\\n100 jar's for each function?\\nDoes each end point need to be represent by single lambda function?\\n\\nI would really appreciate it if you can attache a link for similar scenario!!!\\n\n",

As I understand so far, Cloudwatch Subscription Filter is an event that triggers a lambda to digest the CloudWatch logs and send it to a different destination (ElasticSearch or Firehose or ... another custom lambda). Please correct me if I am wrong. \\nMy concern at the case Cloudwatch Logs Stream to Firehose are: \\n1/ In term of performance + pricing, is there any difference between : \\n\\nCloudwatch Subscription Filter -&gt; Firehose \\nCloudwatch Subscription Filter -&gt; Lambda -&gt; Firehose \\n\\n2/ Which data format does Firehose received from Cloudwatch?\\n\\nCloudwatch Subscription Filter -&gt; Firehose : I don't know\\nCloudwatch Subscription Filter -&gt; Lambda -&gt; Firehose : I think lambda can transform the logs to JSON then put it to Firehose.\\n\\nAny suggestion is appreciated.\\n\n",

Suppose created a lambda function for utils and used that utils in every function of Lambda by invoking lambda instead of replicating.\\n\\nHow does it will affect the pricing?\\nIs it good practice to call the lambda from another lambda in terms of cost?\\nIs it good practice to develop such product in serverless?\\n\\n\n",

For one project we require to purchase server on AWS. I don't know what configuration is required for the server.

For the processing after the upload occurs; I am reviewing two approaches:\\n1) I can use Lambda with ffmpeg to handle the transcoding immediately after the uploading occurs (my fear here would be the amount of time required to transcode the videos and the effect on pricing if it takes a considerable amount of time).  \\n2) I can have s3 pass an sns message to a rest api after the created event occurs and the rest api generate a rabbitmq message that will be processed by worker that will perform the transcoding using ffmpeg.\\nOption 1) seems to be the preferable option based on a completion time perspective.  How concerned should I be with using 1) considering how long video transcoding might take as opposed to option 2)?  \\nAlso, regardless, I need a way to pass additional parameters to lambda or along the sns messaging that would allow me to somehow associate the user who uploaded the video with their account.  Is there a way to pass additional text-based values to s3 to pass along to lambda or along sns when the upload completes, as a caveat I plan to upload the video directly to s3 using the rest layer(found this answer here: )?\\n\n",

There are some very impressive pricing and performance numbers coming in with this new release. Off the top, AWS says that the general cost of using v2 will be 70% cheaper and have 50% lower latency than v1. I'd love to try this out in my existing projects.\\nI use Serverless framework in my application. How do I convert my existing API to use this new feature? This is what my  file looks like:\\n\\n\n",

This is a research project inspired by the findings of a few recent research papers.\\nThis gives a quick overview of one of the papers: \\nThe manager will have the ability to:\\n\\nact as a keep alive function to allow the workload to persist\\ndestroy the lambda executing a workload (in python: call sys.exit()) \\nhave some scheduling properties\\n\\nand so my thinking is that I need a way to send a message or \\ninteract with that lambda instance.\\nMethods for communicating between two lambda instances?\\nI have tried using the Gateway API with websockets but that only lets me redirect to specific lambda functions, which is useful but not for the current problem.\\nI have looked at SNS, I think it can be done with SNS by creating a new topic and passing the arn to the invoked worker lambda but that seems ineffecient.

Will each different request be 1 RCU at minimum or do they sum untill it reaches 1 RCU?\\nWhich of the 3 examples above would be the cheapest following DynamoDB pricing system? Is there another way of doing this?\\nBonus points for the calculation.\\n\n",

I'm specifically talking about the On-Demand mode of DynamoDB\\nBy similar I mean, being able to pay per requests and per GB/Month or similar, instead of paying a fixed monthly fee, I understand this will mostly gear towards NoSQL databases but for me it doesn't matter the type of database.\\nApart from DynamoDB, I have also found FaunaDB, but it lacks documentation and tools/integrations\\nIt's important to note that I'm not considering pay per hour here, as that is irrelevant once you go to production.\\n\n",

A function in AWS Lambda has 512 MB of disk space available (see ) and Azure functions have up to 1000 GB of disk space, depending on the pricing model (see ).\\nHow much does a GCP Function have? \\nWhen searching the documentation, I could only find that functions do have disk storage, but not how much (see ).\\n\n",

It looks very nice and was working well.\\nHowever, the site needs to handle ~1000 small documents - serve, search, and rarely update. In order to reduce calls to the database on every request, which is costly both in time, and in database pricing, I thought it would be better if the server could get the full list of item when it starts (or on the first request), and then hold them in memory and make data request get the data from its memory.\\nIt worked well in the local dev server, but when I deployed it to , it didn't work. It seems , where each request is separate, and I can't use a common in-memory cache to get the data.\\nAm I missing something and there is a way to achieve something like that with  on ?\\nIf not, can you recommend other free cloud services that can provide what I'm looking for?\\n\n",

      "1749    I've got the order microservice that's written as go AWS lambda function.\\nThe main function named order-service bound to API Gateway. It receives several parameters like  of int, creates an order with artifacts and returns serialized order with order_id and total price.\\nThis function invokes a function named order-item which creates an order-item and returns them in parallel(per product). These functions invoke product and user functions to retrieve information about user and products by their ids. \\nThen, the order function invokes another lambda called fee-function which takes just total price and user id and gives back fee price. Of course, it calls some other function like user function and so on. Basically, this is a simple example of how the service works in general. Any function calls some others like user-discount, state taxes etc.\\nThe questions are:\\n\\nIs it good that order function invokes fee function through Amazon, but it can just import fee handler package and run it inside itself?(However, fee function may be called from outside so it must be deployed as a separate function as well)\\nIs it good that each function receives just user id and loads the user invoking user function? Perhaps, better to preload it and pass it through everywhere? Something else?\\nIs it good that one function calls other functions and they call some others and so on? is there any better approach in my situation? Use SNS, Step function, dependency injections/aws layers.\\n\\nThe main reason why I asked is to withstand thousands of RPM and not pay a lot.\\nThanks for helping. I appreciate this. \\n\n",

The Lambda function should connect to an MQTT broker, which is not in the AWS, and I noticed that the Lambda function alone was not able to access to the external resource. I have tried several configurations and it could connect to the broker after creating an NAT gateway. However, the NAT gateway is a charged service and I wonder if it is necessary.\\nHere is my question. Is it necessary to have the charged NAT gateway in my situation for the Lambda function to access to the external resource? If not, what else should I do? I would welcome any idea that would let an Echo Skill publish an MQTT message to my MQTT broker, even without the AWS Lambda.\\nThanks.\\n\n",

However, I am not sure if I will be charged for using the DynamoDB SDK method or for something else or if I might forgetting another possible cost or thing that I am not taking into account.\\nThank you.\\n\n",

Unfortunately we still see the emails comming in.\\nSo we deleted the function and we still keep receiving the error emails.\\nHow can the lambda function still be running.   Would i be experiencing charges since the function is running.\\nJohn\\n\n",

I use Stripe Standard Accounts and a Direct Charge.\\nThe Working Process is:\\n1.) User clics on Button and request Data from Firebase Cloud Functons.\\n2.) Firebase Cloud Functions:\\n2.1.) Create CustomerId (automatically on Platform Account)/ Get Customer Id from Firebase\\n2.2.) Get ephemeralKeys from CustomerId\\n\\n2.3.) Create Payment Intent\\n\\n3.) Then I pass the Data back to the App and pass them into the Payment Sheet\\n\\nProblem:\\nThe Client is created on the Platform Account and the payment data is stored there. If I try to create the Payment Intent with the \"stripeAccount: vendorId\" property ,the Customer Id is not being recognised as it's not being stored on the Connect account.\\nNow what the Stripe Documentation says is to clone the Payment Method:\\n\\nI can not clone the Payment Method because it is being created by flutter_stripe\\nSo I have no idea how to proceed as the flutter_stripe package is not well documented and the package is not compatible to the Stripe Documentation.\\nIs a Payment Sheet a possible solution here at all?\\nThank you very much,\\nTim\\n\n",

I am using Virtualenv 15.1.0 on my home computer and if I install Newspaper with Python 3.5 and then upload to Lambda (Python 3.6 runtime), it throws errors related to PIL / Pillow.  \\nFirst it says it can't find _image, which appears to be resolved by deleting the PIL directory in site-packages, however that just results in it throwing the error that it can't find PIL.\\nIf, however, I build with Python 3.6 and then upload to Lambda, it works just fine (whether I delete PIL or not).\\nSo, that appears to me that I can't install Newspaper with 3.5 and try to execute in a 3.6 runtime.\\nSo, now I am trying to deploy via Codestar, however Codestar seems to default to aws/codebuild/eb-nodejs-4.4.6-amazonlinux-64:2.1.3, even for Python projects, and all it seems to have available in the Yum repository is Python 3.5 and of course Lambda only has the 3.6 runtime.\\nEven if I switch the image within Codebuild itself, there don't seem to be any images built with the Python3.6 runtime (according to the documentation). Even the Docker images seem to lack Python 3.6.\\nSo, I am trying to install Python 3.6 in Codebuild during the INSTALL phase in my buildspec.yml file, however I can't find the python3* executable after the install.\\nThe only other thing I can think of is to create the Codestar project, edit codebuild to use Ubuntu and then install everything (just like I did locally), but there is no way to do that from within Codestar and I feel like that may bring me down a rabbit hole and that's hardly automated.  Is there a way to make that configuration as code from within my project?\\nEDIT\\nAttempting to build and install Python 3.6 from source works, but then when trying to install Pip, I get errors saying SSL was not installed.  And when looking back at the build logs, it seems other \"bits\" were not installed as well.\\nSo, my questions here are:\\n\\nHow do I get Python 3.6 into a Codebuild environment provisioned from a Codestar project?\\nShould I continue trying to build it from source or make the switch to the Ubuntu environment?\\nHow can I automatically configure the image / environment within my code/project?\\n\\nEDIT 1 For anyone else, my complete buildspec.yml for installing and using Python3.6 is below. Note, it keeps everything as quiet as possible in order to reduce the log messages, reduce Cloudwatch cost and speed up the process.  I ended up shaving about 90 seconds off the whole process by doing that (installing Python and building my app).  Since CodeBuild charges based on time spent, this is crucial.\\n\\n\n",

Both external APIs just return a single boolean and therefore don't send much info.\\nWhich technique is better overall?\\n\\nMake both external API calls using  at the same time knowing that 1 may be useless half the time.\\n\\nMake the external API call one after the other, and not make the second one if not needed.\\n\\n\\nI'm thinking doing #1 will shorten the \"wall time\" of my cloud function and therefore may be cheaper? But I make more external calls which may be expensive?\\nBut doing #2 will make the cloud function stay in memory for longer and therefore more \"wall time\".\\n\n",

So if I use 10min chunks this will result in a 24 kB file. dynamoDB charges write capacities by item size (1 write capacity unit = 1 kB). So this would require 24 units for a single write. Reads (4kB/unit) are even worse since a user may request timeframes greater than 10 min. So for a request covering e.g. 6 hours (=864kB) it would require a read capacity of 216. This will just be too expensive considering multiple users.\\nWhen I read directly from S3 I face the browser limiting the number of concurrent requests. The 6 hour timespan for instance would cover 36 files. This might still be acceptable, considering a connection limit of 6. But a request for 24 hours (=144 files) would just take too long.\\n\\nAny idea how to solve the problem?\\nbest regards, Chris\\n\n",

I know that the first 1 million requests and the first 400000GB-second compute time if free are free. After that, it will charge 0.20USD per million requests and 400,000 seconds if the function is 1GB RAM. What I am not clear here is how the computing time is charged.\\nLet's say one request is \"0.0000002USD\". One the client makes the request, it already charged 0.0000002USD no matter how long it was run. The computing time is charged once the function starts running based on how much memory it consumes and how long it was run for. Is that correct? Let's say the function was run for 2 hours, but it only consumed 1GB RAM (which is not realistic - just for the educational purpose), so it is gonna charge me 0.0000002USD + (cost of execution/ computing for 400,000 seconds). Am I right?\\nCan anyone confirm and explain?\\n\n",

The Date and Time to deliver are parameters received by the function. Any thoughts? I couldn't find much searching on the web.\\nThanks in advance!\\n\n",
      "15670    The thing what i want do:\\nI'm thinking about use aws dynamodb as my new web site(press and bbs mixed type) main server.\\nBut I can't design database, because dynamodb maybe cannot satisfy my requirements.\\nSomebody knows how can i do?\\nFoundation\\nMy boss's plan is spawning many websites and close it several days after if it's traffic is low. (and go on until it success)\\nHe has many domain names (over hundreads) and want make many websites.\\nAnd he also wants selling our system for web solution to customers. ( internet newspaper, blogs, magazines, etc... )\\nIt is very large plan, anyway i must design the system.  \\nSituation\\nfirst, most of website is going trashcan after several days.\\nso make each websites on on-premise server is not good way because it means too much manual-jobs. (just deploying the site, undeploying the site)\\nAnd also on-premised pricing is not good in this case because we can't predict any webserver is closing (because traffic size lower than survive-line), or survive because traffic is grow faster.\\ni guess 80% of sites are just ghost sites.  \\nsecond, the amount of spawining websites are not measurable. Because my boss always yelled me 'as many as can!'  \\nAnd I also consider about this project is abandoned by my company after launching some month after. (maybe they want keep-and-not-maintain mode with not consume many price)   \\nAnyway, ths problem is the...\\n1. can't predict how many sites are alive and gets high traffic.\\n2. can't predict how many sites are ghosts or few traffics (under 1000users/days).\\n3. even the project is abandoned, the'll want keep-and-not-maintain-mode (with lowcost as they can)\\nconslusion is\\n1. most sites are going to keep-and-not-maintain-mode. it's cost must low\\n2. some few sites are 'burst' in after times. it must support this situation also.  \\nSo next is my answer:\\nServer : full faas serverless with stateless server (lambda, cloudrun, function, etc... i think cloudrun is best because development is very it can easy using my own docker)\\nthe reason is...\\nif this website is 'just keep and not maintain it', we did not pay for it. or very small price.\\nif the site growing up or traffic is burst, it can support on-live.  \\nDatabase : serverless because it's traffic is not measurable in this stage.\\nthere only two serverless (means needs no pay for provisioned instance). Aurora and Dynamodb.  \\nAurora is my first choice because I always using mysql or mariadb in webservice.\\nBut there is two problem.\\nAurora serverless is too sensitive acu scaling. and it never going scale-down until 5 minutes flowed. (and if it scaled up to 4 acu, 5*4=20acu/min. just one connection and query once, but pricing=$0.03)\\nIt is pretty sure if one of these site's traffic is changed from 'nobody use it' to 'a few people comes', Autoscale price is going to very higher. even i set max acu scale limit to 1, there are another problems. (well-known problems). If aurora start from cold, it takes very long time(about 30seconds). And if it is scaling, it also takes some delay.\\nAnyway, i can't make good pricing design for Aurora.  \\nSo I moved on Dynamodb.\\nIt has very good pricing rules. In on-demand mode, under $2 per 1,000,000 rcu.\\nI guess most of site data is stored in S3. So read/write other data is not much than 1kb/4kb, and even i transaction for each unit, under $2 per 500,000rcu.  \\nActual Problem\\nBut it has trap point.\\nIf I do scan, its pricing is going to very higher. because returns a lot of data (until 1mb). I accepted. So I must using query. But query is working same as 'scan in a partition'. And pricing is going to scanned amount of read-write-units(until 1mb). So if I have 100 items in a key and query just one item (total 100 members and just select one of that members), the dynamodb charges 100 times pricing because it scanned 100 items. (assume each item lower than 1kb). I cant believe it. (x100 pricing) so googled it.\\nI found many people are design dynamodb seperated hash-key. (like 'members-startfrom-a', 'members-startfrom-b', ... )\\nQuestion\\nIs it normal?\\nIn this time, I think dynamodb cannot support normal website (bbs or press, or blog). because they are rdb optimized structures. Even paging articles needs full-scan(or partitioned full-scan).  Is it right? or there is a 'migration rules' for rdb user to dynamodb user?\\nSomeone can show me 'case-study'?\\nMost case people use dynamodb as subdb.  \\n\n",

This is a problem because my account concurrency is set at 3000, so if I start adding more jobs then eventually I'm going to have &gt;3000 concurrent Lambda instances.\\nEach job takes around 2-5 seconds to complete which means that within each 1 minute window the concurrency limit will only be threatened within the first 5 seconds and I'll have 0 concurrency for the remaining 55 seconds.\\nIf I set a concurrency limit (e.g. 1000) for the lambda will it handle the first 1000 SNS events and then automatically pick up the remainder once the concurrency frees up? And will I only be charged for the actual runtime rather than time spent waiting for concurrency to reduce?\\nOtherwise, is there a way that AWS will allow me to spread the load of jobs throughout the 1 minute window so that I can invoke the lambda every ~5 seconds with a subset of the total number of jobs?\\n\n",

I will be polling it until the object exists\\n2) What other way could I achieve this that doesn't incur charges?\\n3) What method do I use to check if a file exists in S3? (just try to get it and check status code?)\\n\n",

How do stop and resume the function so that I don't incur charges and I don't loose data in the stream.\\nI know that if the events keep failing, Kinesis will keep retrying and the cost can be very high.\\nI cannot delete the function because there is lots of automation around it through CloudFormation. Is there a way to stop and restart the function?\\nSOLUTION:   \\nNOTE: Event sources for rules, log streaming, cannot be disable using the event source. You will not event get it in the list when calling the API using the SDK. For those you have to disable the Event Rule, or the Log Subscription.\\n\n",

I am planning to host my videos on vooplayer (now spotlightr) and just have the front end web page with authentication, few pages to display the course videos. I am thinking I can host the website on S3, use Cognito for authentication and authorization and store user data and course data i.e. video urls in DynamoDB and may be few Lambda functions and API Gateway.\\nAm I going in the right direction in choosing this serverless architecture for the use case?\\nI am just going to store few collection in DynamoDB\\n\\nUser - email, name\\nCourse - course id, course name, external (vooplayer/spotlightr) video url, cost\\nPurchase - email, course, date of purchase, amount paid, currency\\nActivity - email, course id, started at, valid till\\n\\nI estimate there will be 100 users in next 6 months, may be more if things goes well.\\nI hope storing this data shouldn't cost much in the long run.\\nI chose vooplayer/spotlightr for their encryption and making it really difficult for malicious users to download and play the videos unlike other popular video streaming platforms we know.\\nI hope streaming video from external hosting sites with front end hosted on AWS won't get charged. Please correct me and point me in the right direction otherwise.\\nI know I could use off-the-shelf products like Udemy, Teachable, etc. I am between jobs and want to build something and learn something new while building it. Please advise.\\n\n",

Already looking to implement usage of  in several decentralized app projects. However, I don't yet understand how you can prevent abuse of your endpoint from a 3rd-party app (perhaps even a competitor), from driving up your usage costs. \\nI'm not talking about a DDoS, or where all the traffic is coming from a single IP, which can happen on any network, but specifically having a 3rd-party app's customers directly make the REST calls, which cause your usage costs to rise, because their app is piggy-backing on your \"open\" endpoints.\\nFor example:\\nI wish to create an endpoint on AWS Lambda to give me the  What would prevent another (or every) dapp developer from using MY lambda endpoint and causing excessive billing charges to my account?\\n\n",

Also, the website is currently hosted on AWS Lambda (using the Serverless framework), and only deployed in the eu-west-1 region (Ireland) only.\\nThe website doesn't sell anything online: It's an information website, not e-commerce.\\n\\nI've looked into this issue for a few hours, but I'm a bit lost regarding the exact steps needed to make it happen.\\nHere are a few questions I haven't found answers for:\\n\\nDoes deploying the lambda to  (China Beijing) is a requirement or can Chinese users access my  lambda if I get an ICP license?\\n\\nRegardless of the deploying region, I seem to need an ICP License, as the AWS FAQ says at\\n:\\n\\nQ: Do I need to file for ICP Recordal or ICP License if I want to host public content on AWS China (Beijing) Region or AWS China (Ningxia) Region?\\nYes. In accordance with Chinese laws and regulations, if you use either AWS China Region to host a website providing non-commercial internet information services, you must undertake filing procedures for a non-commercial website (“ICP Recordal”) through the relevant government authority. If you use either AWS China Region to host a website providing commercial internet information services, you must obtain a value-added telecommunications license for a commercial website (“ICP License”) from the relevant government authority. You may be required to produce your ICP Recordal or ICP License, as applicable, before you host public content using one of the AWS China Regions.\\nAWS China (Beijing) Region is operated by Sinnet, who is responsible for content hosted in the Beijing Region, while AWS China (Ningxia) Region is operated by NWCD, who is responsible for content hosted in the Ningxia Region. Both Sinnet and NWCD provide support at no additional charge for customers seeking ICP related services, though customers are responsible for any fees imposed by the applicable government authorities. To learn more about the filing procedures, please visit Sinnet at  and NWCD at .\\n\\nAs for actually getting the license, it's a bit out of topic here, but I couldn't understand the first provider workflow:\\n\\n website is a mix of english and chinese and I got lost in translation (even when using their english website version)\\n seems to require to send an email to support@amazonaws.com.cn, no idea what happens next\\n\\nAnyway, the process seems to take around 4-6 weeks. So, it likely takes even more time than that.\\n\\nRegarding the technical details now, it seems like the China region ( Beijing and  Ningxia) behave in a very particular way on AWS Lambda.\\n\\nThey only support  endpoints\\nThey do not support native Serverless  variables\\n\\nSee\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlso, there are technical impacts on the website itself:\\n\\nGoogle services are banned, or limited (Google Analytics (limited), Google Tag Manager, Google Fonts (banned)) and must be changed, converted to owned CDN, etc.\\n\\nAnd I've probably missed other technical limitations, since that's just those I learned about within 2h of digging around.\\nAre there other steps I overlooked? (regulation or technical)\\nDo you have any advices or feedback about how to make a website hosted on AWS Lambda available in China?\\n\n",

The Lambda is running Node.js and referencing audio files which I use SSML for playback on Alexa commands. However, since I get charged for GET requests, I'd like to limit the requests to just the servers requesting specifically from Alexa. Although I can set an IAM user to restrict access, I think I'll get an access denied response when trying to play back from Alexa. Can I restrict playback based on a known Alexa IP? It appears that the IAM information isn't passed through regular HTTP requests to S3 GETs. \\n\n",

I don't want AWS Lambda to make this request as I will be charged for the time it is waiting for the response.  Is there any way to use AWS Lambda to handle the response without being charged while waiting?\\n\n",

Let me know if I should ask this on some other SX.  \\nThe question is about FaaS in general, but if you can better explain this in a context of a particular FaaS platform/provider, that's great as well.  \\nI'm currently reading up on serverless computing (FaaS to be more specific) and trying to get myself somewhat comfortable with the subject. \\nNow almost everywhere I turn, I encounter the following statements about FaaS:\\n1) Most FaaS platforms support down-to-zero scaling;\\n2) FaaS providers charge their users based on their function execution time (usually measured in ms);\\n3) Potential cold starts (i.e., creating a new instance instead of reusing an existing one) are an issue in FaaS as they considerably degrade performance of your application;\\nPoints 1 and 2 are considered benefits - you get exactly what you need (including nothing at all, if applicable) andy pay for exactly what you get.\\nPoint 3 is considered a drawback - the request takes considerably more time to complete. I've seen authors describing cold starts as a sign of FaaS platforms not yet being mature. I've seen practitioners saying that they set up periodic requests just to keep their functions from becoming inactive and \"going under\" thus triggering the cold start the next time it's called.\\nMy question is - why are cold starts viewed as undesirable instead of as a trade-off?\\nWhat I mean is, considering that the user pays for execution time in FaaS, wouldn't it usually be in their best interests to avoid having warm, but idle function instances? To me it seems like a cost vs high availibility decision. Do I misunderstand something? Does having a warm, but idle function instance does not count towards one's execution time? Even if so:\\na) isn't it undesirable from the providers' perspective (having to allocate resources that are neither used nor paid for)?\\nb) sending periodic requests (as mentioned above) surely does cost you, right?\\n\n",

Obviously that file could be any size, and might be served at any speed. I am concerned that might create Denial of Service and Denial of Wallet risks.\\nI don't know if aws have any charges for lambda ingress, I haven't been able to find a definitive answer yet. Even if they don't though, large uploads could still force my lambdas to run for longer (costing me money) and potentially pushing me up against the rate limits I have set, in part, to mitigate flooding attack risk (denying people service).\\nLikewise, very slow downloads might cause my lambdas to run til they time out. My timeouts are set fairly high because there is processing to do once the file is downloaded. I'd rather bale after a small handful of seconds as the input data should always be small and fast.\\nSo what I want is for downloads to abort if they hit a preset maximum size in bytes OR a maximum download time.\\nIf adding these limits isn't possible with Axios then I'm open to using different libraries like node-fetch.\\n\n",

I tried a few things mentioned in this link:, but still the application takes around 45 secs to start.\\nThings I tried:  \\n\\nAsync initialization from the above link. It did help a bit but not enough.  \\nSkip the Init phase of the lambda. It helped reduce almost 8 secs.  \\nProvisioned concurrency but as far as I could see, it is not helping either. When I saw the logs, the spring context is getting initialized every time, if any request comes after an interval of 15-20 mins.\\n\\nThe response time of my lambda in different scenarios is: \\n\\nTo reduce this response time, I am thinking of making a REST call to my lambda every 5 or 10 mins so as to keep the spring context in memory and that in turn would help serve the requests faster. This call will be like a health check call, very less to no processing at all.\\nIs this an advisable approach? Or is there a better way of achieving this goal? \\nI am unclear about AWS will charge in this case.\\n\n",

I am on the free tier and I haven't used the work-in-progress functions for a couple of days, but today I realized in the cost overview that I have used about 9000 hours and will possibly use about 12000 at the end of the month. See here:\\n\\nSo was wondering why?\\nI know that you reserve the hourly capacity. And since none of the skills is live, I sticked with 5 RCU/WCU for each table (it says 25 RCU/WCU is okay for the free tier). But these numbers doesn't make sense? \\nOr do they? \\nAnd the question is what happens when I scale this down to 1 RCU/WCU when all the skills go live? \\nI know that this would mean that only one request per second can be processed, but I am sure that this would be enough for the skills (at least for the first couple of month) - I guess that I won't have more than 200-300 monthly users. Will this significantly reduce the above numbers? Or will I be charged huge bill for some reason I don't understand after going though the documentation?\\n\n",

      "6878     I need to create something on Azure that can process incoming streams of messages for a set of entities. We will have anywhere between 20 and 2,000 entities at any point in time; these get created and discarded dynamically. Messages will be generated using our on-premises system, and sent to Azure using some queueing mechanism. Each message will be associated with a specific entity through an  property. Messages belonging to the same entity must be processed in-order with respect to each other. \\nAt the same time, the solution must be scalable with respect to entities. If I have steady streams of messages for 1,000 entities, I'd want to have 1,000 concurrent executions of my logic. If an entity takes a long time to process one of its messages, this must not block any of the other entities from processing their messages. Each message may take anywhere from 100ms to 10s to process (vast majority below 1s), and each entity would receive an average of one message per second.\\nDisappointingly, the Azure serverless stack does not seem to have any means of achieving this. These are the options I've considered and their problems:\\n\\nAzure Functions triggered by Service Bus queue with sessions. Azure Functions can be run as serverless on a consumption plan, making them perfect for elastic scaling. Service Bus sessions provide for in-order delivery, and are the closest implementation of my requirements. However, they are not supported in Azure Functions: .\\nLogic Apps triggered by Service Bus queue with sessions: This is supported out-of-the-box through the \"\" template. The Logic App can then hook to an HTTP-triggered Azure Function for processing messages. The Logic App's only purpose is to prevent multiple messages belonging to the same entity/session from being processed concurrently. However, from the comments to my , I found this would not be scalable either. A Logic App can only execute 300,000 actions per 5 minutes, has a trigger concurrency limit of 50, and is said to be expensive. See .\\nAzure Event Hubs with partitions, as discussed in . This tends to be the most popular option, and the one recommended by Microsoft. However, Event Hubs only permit up to 32 partitions, with the number of partitions needing to be specified at creation: . This limitation of a fixed static set of partitions goes against the spirit of \"serverless\"; if we're limiting our degree of parallelism to 32, then we're not getting any better scalability than a parallel application running on a 32-core machine. The partition limit can be increased beyond 32 via a support ticket to Microsoft, but I wouldn't want to ask for scalability that's two orders of magnitude beyond what's available for general use. Event Hubs also lack some other basic properties, such as at-most-once delivery.\\nWe can dynamically create a Service Bus queue per entity, and have a singleton Azure Function spawned for it, bound exclusively to that specific queue. However, this would entail invoking the Azure resource management APIs as part of our operational code, and my impression is that Azure Functions weren't designed to be spawned dynamically this way.\\nOptimistic concurrency control against a persistent backing store, such as Redis, using the  property of the Service Bus queue messages for ordering. However, the programming model for this is quite complex and easy to get wrong – operations need to be performed in retry loops with consideration explicitly paid to atomicity and idempotency each time. Also, it requires all messages to contain the full entity state; otherwise, information would be lost when we discard stale messages in case of races. It would be expensive for us (in terms of computation and bandwidth) to send the full entity snapshot with each incremental change, so we'd rather find a means that would allow us to process incremental messages in-order instead.\\n\\nIs there any clean way of achieving in-order processing for a scalable number of entities on the Azure serverless stack?\\n\n",

That would be the perfect solution for me because my lambda functions need internet access and a NAT Gateway which would allow that when inside a VPC is way too expensive. In which cases is it safe to go for that option? When is it a bad idea to have an RDS outside a VPC? What are the risks?\\n\n",

Basically I have a lambda that reads a file on S3 which is used as configuration. This file is a JSON. I am using python with boto3 to extract the needed info.\\nSnippet of my code:\\n\\nThe problem is that when I change the json content and I upload the file again on S3, my lambda seems to read the old values, which I suppose is due to S3 doing caching somewhere.\\nNow I think that there are two ways to solve this problem:\\n\\nto force S3 to invalidate its cache content\\nto force my lambda to reload the file from S3 without using the cache\\n\\nI do prefer the first solution, because I think it will reduce computation time (reloading the file is an expensive procedure). So, how can I flush my cache? I didn't find on console or on AWS guide the way to do this in a simple manner\\n\n",

The resource in question is collaborative, so it is reasonable to expect that there will be parallel write requests arriving concurrently.\\nIf the number of writes is small, then this is relatively straight forward to do with a simple lambda - read the current state, compute the new state, compare and swap, spin until the swap succeeds or until we give up.  In either case, we compute the appropriate http response and return it to the caller.\\nIf the API is successful, then eventually the waste of conflicting writes becomes expensive enough to address.\\nIt looks as though the natural response is to copy the requests into a queue, with a function that consumes batches; within each batch, we process the requests in sequence, storing the new write, and computing the appropriate response to the request.\\nWhat are the options for getting those computed responses copied into the http responses, and what are the trade offs to be be considered?\\nMy sense is that in handling the http request, after (synchronously) enqueue the message, I need to block/poll on something that will eventually be populated with the response to the request.\\n\n",

Because of the way S3 stores things in Deep Storage, it never makes sense to archive objects which are 8KB or smaller (because you will pay for 8KB of Standard anyway).  Lifecycle rules are not smart enough to handle this logic, so I wrote a .  However, I'm not sure what trigger to use.  Right now, this lambda only responds to  events- which works fine for my simple online testing, but I suspect may not work when I'm doing the transfer with a Snowcone or Snowball.  The lambda itself then causes an  event if it archives the file.\\nSo in order to get this to work with Snowcone/Snowball, it'd be nice to know: what event is generated when the files are transferred off those devices into S3?  I've contemplated just using DynamoDB and pushing archived filenames into a table so I have a reference, but that seems unnecessary if I can get firm guidance.  Another option is to be brutish about it and simply force-archive on every event received, because as far as I can tell, it is as expensive to query the current storage class of the object as it is to attempt the change in storage class.\\nChecked all the docs, including the 184 page Snowcone User guide PDF.   suggests that the  and  events refer back to HTTP, but I don't think the Snow family existed at the time.  I tweeted at Jeff Barr and haven't heard back yet.  Anyone have actual experience with these devices?\\n\n",

This file is 3.75 GB and is too large to put directly in a lambda. Currently I have this program running in an extra large EC2 instance, but this option is expensive. The code also only runs on demand around four times a week, so keeping a server running constantly is not what I want.\\n\\nIs there any way I can convert this to serverless?\\nIf I use EFS, aren't I just converting one server to a server plus a lambda?\\nIs there an API I can talk to which would return the same information that Spacy can, specifically similarity of two sentences?\\n\\n\n",

Both external APIs just return a single boolean and therefore don't send much info.\\nWhich technique is better overall?\\n\\nMake both external API calls using  at the same time knowing that 1 may be useless half the time.\\n\\nMake the external API call one after the other, and not make the second one if not needed.\\n\\n\\nI'm thinking doing #1 will shorten the \"wall time\" of my cloud function and therefore may be cheaper? But I make more external calls which may be expensive?\\nBut doing #2 will make the cloud function stay in memory for longer and therefore more \"wall time\".\\n\n",

That works just fine.  But the other aws services now are giving me problems.  They tend to just hang and never return.\\nI understand that I should use vpc endpoints specific to the aws services to make them work, but they are not consistently working or do not exist.  Here's what I have:\\n\\nlambda -&gt; aws secret manager using secretmanager endpoint: works fine\\nlambda -&gt; invoking other lamdas using lambda endpoint: works fine\\nlambda -&gt; s3 does not work with interface endpoint, but does work with gateway endpoint.\\nlambda -&gt; aws ses using smtp-email endpoint: hangs\\nlambda -&gt; aws cognito admin functions (such as adminCreateUser), cannot find a cognito endpoint type:  hangs\\n\\nI have created a separate, non-vpc lambda that calls the SES api.  My vpc lambda invokes this non-vpc lambda with parameters to send email.\\nThis does work, but seems kludgey.   My old non-vpc code worked fine.   Before calling ses or doing anything dangerous, I checked custom permissions in my database.  But this new non-vpc lambda does not have access to the database and therefore is missing this check close to the api call.  This non-vpc lambda feels like potential weapon of mass destruction.\\nApparently, I could use a NAT gateway. But a NAT gateway is expensive, especially if I want redundancy.  And using the public internet defeats the purpose of using a vpc in the first place.\\n\\nWhy is the smtp-email endpoint not working while secretmanager and lambda endpoints do work?\\nHow can I call cognito admin functions from a vpc-based lambda if there is no cognito endpoint type?\\nIf there is no available endpoint type for a specific aws service (such as cognito), does that mean a NAT gateway is required?\\nAre lambda functions without an apig interface safe from being invoked by hackers over the internet?\\nIs using a non-vpc lambda to access aws services from a vpc lambda actually a good idea?\\nShould I just use a NAT gateway?\\n\\n\n",

And the console configuration is very confusing.\\nWill a Docker Cluster running in Fargate mode behind a Load Balancer shutdown and not charge me while it's not being used?\\nWhat about cold starts? Do I need to care about this in Fargate like in Lambda?\\nIs it less horizontal than Lambda? A lambda hooked to API Gateway will spawn a new function for every concurrent request, will Fargate do this too? Or will the load balancer decide it?\\nI've been running Flask/Django applications in Lambda for some time (Using Serverless/Zappa), are there any benefits in migrating them to Fargate? \\nIt seems to be that it is more expensive than Lambda but if the Lambda limitations are not a problem then Lambda should always be the better choice right?\\n\n",

Also, since I have about 10 steps, I assume it would be hard to implement and also expensive to try to use S3 for storage of this inter-steps data.\\nSecond guess was calling multiple lambdas from single lambda, and wait for all responses. Since I use AWS C++ SDK, it seems a bit complicated since there is almost no documentation for c++ or good examples of this case.\\nThe simplest solution for me would be to create multiple threads inside single lambda, but it supports only 2 cores, which is also not working for me, I need at least 50-100.\\nDo you have any other solution or idea, as simple as possible. Is it possible to use aws batch or sqs for this or something else?\\n\n",

They copy files into SFTP every 15 minutes, so we have files there added incrementally and then they delete files on SFTP which are older than 3 days.\\nSo imagine we have 3000 or more files in our S3 (we need to keep them all in a S3 bucket) and then every day we have around 100 new files that need to be copied from SFTP to S3 ( all the new files which are added into SFTP).\\nI have a lambda function which runs every hour to handle it, but what is the most optimised way to do it:\\n\\nReading all SFTP file names (using ssh2-sftp-client library) and\\ncheck which ones are not copied in S3 (using s3.headObject to check\\nif file exists in S3) and then copy them. A bit expensive to iterate\\nthrough all SFTP file name and see if they exists in S3, more than 1\\nminute.\\nReading all S3 bucket file names, reading all SFTP file names and then compare which ones are not included and then copy those. (not sure if it's reasonable performance wise)\\nor any other solutions\\n\\nany better ideas?\\n\n",

I've tried Cloud9 but I'm looking for an environment that's not browser-based and with an app for mac. IntelliJ seems like an option too but it's a bit expensive for my needs. \\nAny free / cheap alternatives for just editing the code of the Lambda-functions in an independent app for mac? \\n\n",

Because of the high load and intermittent usage, we're looking into Lambda function deployment. However - our packages are big. \\nI'm trying to fit AllenNLP in a lambda function, which in turn depends on pytorch, scipy, spacy and numpy and a few other libs. \\nWhat I've tried\\nFollowing recommendations made  and the example , tests and additional files are removed. I also use a non-cuda version of Pytorch which gets its' size down. I can package an AllenNLP deployment down to about 512mb. Currently, this is still too big for AWS Lambda. \\nPossible fixes?\\nI'm wondering if anyone of has experience with one of the following potential pathways:\\n\\nCutting PyTorch out of AllenNLP. Without Pytorch, we're in reach of getting it to 250mb. We only need to load archived models in production, but that does seem to use some of the PyTorch infrastructure. Maybe there are alternatives?\\nInvoking PyTorch in (a fork of) AllenNLP as a second lambda function. \\nUsing S3 to deliver some of the dependencies: SIMlinking some of the larger  files and serving them from an S3 bucket might help. This does create an additional problem: the Semnatic Role Labelling we're using from AllenNLP also requires some language models of around 500mb, for which the ephemeral storage could be used - but maybe these can be streamed directly into RAM from S3?\\n\\nMaybe i'm missing an easy solution.

My endpoints are publicly available by its nature so I don't want to authenticate users through my client app hosted on Netlify.\\nWhat I do need is to restrict access to my endpoints so that other applications or malicious users can't abuse it. It is not about scaling, I just don't want to exceed the  since it is a demo of an opensource application.\\nI've already set the  and  limits to minimum but this alone is not enough. There is also a product named  but it seems an expensive one, not free.\\nI was expecting to have a simple built-in solution for this but couldn't find it.\\nWhat other solutions do I have? How can I block the traffic coming out of my website on Netlify?\\n\n",

Problem is, with AWS Lambda I can't make 20000 requests and wait for their callbacks at the same time (I get a request limit exceeded error).\\nWith some setup I could user ,  or , but they only go up to 64 cores, so if I need more than that, I'd still have to setup all the machines I need separately and orchestrate the communication between them with something like , handling the different low level setups for master and compute instances (accessing via ssh and etc).\\nSo is there any service I can just paste my Node JS code, maybe choose the number of cores and run (not having to care about OS, or how many computers there are in my cluster)?\\nI'm looking for something that can take that code:\\n\\nAnd run each thread on a separate core so they can run simultaneously (therefore finishing faster).\\n\n",

But I have doubt if in terms of memory and CPU resources usage choosing between NodeJS  or Java could affect the amount lost because of memory or the time execution of a lambda function will take to to the task. \\nI need care about these aspects it is desirable to spend the less amount as possible with AWS Lambda for this kind of task?\\nDoesn't matter choosing between NodeJs or Java? \\nShould I consider use the Elastic Transcode Service instead a custom library in lambda function?\\nThanks for your help.\\n\n",

This means it takes at least 360s (i.e. 6 mins) to completely download the file. AWS Lambda functions however have an upper limit of 300s run time, which effectively makes it impossible to use for this task as the Lambda times-out and exits before the file is completely downloaded.\\nI'm looking for suggestions of ways of working around the 300s run time limit of AWS Lambda to achieve this goal.\\nAs long as I'm sticking to AWS, the only alternative I see is to set up a cron job on an EC2 instance, but that seems expensive / overkill, especially if I end up not needing an always-on EC2 for anything else.\\nThanks!\\n\n",

How can I do this?\\n\\nWhy don't you just use the included boto3 SDK?\\n\\n\\n\\n (\"If you do not provide anything for ContentType to ExtraArgs, the end content type will always be binary/octet-stream.\")\\n (\"By default the mime type of a file is guessed when it is uploaded\")\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor my use case I think it makes sense architecturally and financially, but I'm open to alternatives. :\\n\\ndownloads Git and Hugo\\ndownloads \\nruns Hugo to generate my small (&lt;100 pages) website\\nuploads the generated files to s3\\n\\nRight now, I'm able to do all of the above on a 1536 MB (the most powerful) Lambda function in around 1-2 seconds. This function is only triggered when I commit changes to my website, so it's inexpensive to run.\\n\\nMaybe it is already installed in the Lambda environment?\\n\\nAs of the time of this writing, it is not.\\n\n",

After that, my S3 costs really increased (from $12.27 to $31).\\nQuestion 1: As this is uploaded from a CI/CD pipeline, could it be that it's storing every version and then increasing costs?\\nQuestion 2: Is this storage alternative more expensive than choosing directly an owned s3 bucket instead of the private one owned by Amazon where this zip goes? Looking at the S3 prices list, only 2MB can't result in 19 Dollars.\\nThanks!\\n\n",

I am aware that there are wonderful SaaS providers such as , but the price for the thousands of user accounts we will require is prohibitively expensive.\\nI have discovered , which is useful, but not .  For now, I only require a  grant, which seems very simple.  But I would like to be able to leverage some  which will make it easier to implement more grants and flows for the future.  I have investigated   and  libraries, but the documentation appears to be useless for my requirements.\\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to proceed?\\n\n",

As I was including dependencies and developing new features, the function packages got bigger an bigger (now they are around 250MB). This makes deployment take a while.\\nOn top of that every time I edit  and then run  to try a new configuration on S3, RDS, etc... I have to wait for gradle to build the function again (even though it's unchanged since the last deployment) and upload the whole package to S3.\\nAs I'm trying to configure this application with many trials and errors on SAM, waiting for this process to complete just to get an error because of some misconfiguration is getting quite counterproductive.\\nAlso my SAM s3 bcuket is at 10GB size after just a single day of work. This may get expensive on the long run.\\nIs there a way to avoid those gradle rebuilds and reuploads when teh function code is unchanged?\\n\n",

It often runs over the AWS Lambda limit of 15 minutes. \\nThe function is responsible for making loads of API calls, and unfortunately I have not taken the time to make them all async yet.\\nThe workflow for the function looks something roughly like this:\\n\\nReceive data for xxx clients (1 api call)\\nPlace API call for each client and wait for response (xxx api calls)\\nBased on #2 API call response, place yet another API call for each client and wait for response (xxx api calls)\\nStore response from #3 in DynamoDB (xxx DB updates)\\n\\nInitially my plan was to just keep everything in 1 lambda function, and modify my code such that all API calls run async, and to do one big dynamoDB batch update at the end.\\nHowever, it occurs to me that theoretically this function could still grow too large in the future, if we start needing to run it for enormous numbers of clients. Additionally, in my opinion, managing all those python async calls can be a bit cumbersome in specific situations.\\nMy second approach, is to chain together lambda functions. That is, create a second lambda function, let's name it \"order_for_single_client\", which perform steps #2-4 for just one client.\\nThe top level lambda function will gather data on all clients, and for each one, make a separate lambda call to \"order_for_single_client\". So, if we need to order for 500 clients, the top level function will just make 500 separate lambda calls. Naturally, all the async behavior should take care of itself on the end of AWS since it will run the lambda functions in parallel. (with the exception of the batch dynamoDB update we wanted, but we can worry about that later).\\n\\nWhat is the preferred way of handling this situation from an architecture perspective? Splitting things up into a lambda chain, or trying to speed things up using async inside a single lambda function?\\nIf we were to implement the lambda chain, will it be more or less expensive to run at scale compared to the single function async approach?\\nIs there a third design solution to this problem that I have not considered? (Apart from spinning up an EC2 instance, which I would prefer not to do).\\n\\n\n",

So the official approach stands for incorporating a lambda function into a VPC plus establishing a NAT gateway/instance or VPC endpoints in order to reach the internet and AWS services. Moreover, I can read this is not recommended and should be treated as the final solution. It slows down lambda and increases cold starts.\\nGenerally, I need access to the internet and reach other AWS services from the lambda, which must make requests to ECS tasks. Those tasks are crucial contributors to my flow I'd like them to be easily callable from lambda functions. I'm not sure if VPC lambdas would make sense if I need to pay for NAT, which is comparatively expensive. Maybe I missed something.\\nIs it possible to avoid incorporating lambdas into VPC and still be able to call ECS services? If not, what is the best way to cuts costs related to NAT?\\nI'd appreciate any form of help.\\n\n",

Firstly, a lambda function say F1 which when invoked will get 100 links from a site. Most of these links say about 95 are the same as when F1 was invoked the previous time, so further processing must be done with only those 5 \"new\" links. One solution was to write to a Dynamodb database the links that are processed already and each time the F1 is invoked, query the database and skip those links. But I found that the \"database read\" although in milliseconds is doubling up lambda runtime and this can add up especially if F1 is called frequently and if there are say a million processed links. So I decided to use Elasticache with Redis.\\nI quickly found that Redis can be accessed only when F1 runs on the same VPC and because F1 needs access to the internet you need NAT. (I don't know much about networking) So I followed the guidelines and set up VPC and NAT and got everything to work. I was delighted with performance improvements, almost reduced the expected lambda cost in half to 30$ per month. But then I found that NAT is not included in the free tier and I have to pay almost 30$ per month just for NAT. This is not ideal for me as this project can be in development for months and I feel like I am paying the same amount as compute just for internet access.\\nI would like to know if I am making any fundamental mistakes. Am I using the Elasticache in the right way? Is there a better way to access both Redis and the internet? Is there any way to structure my stack differently so that I retain the performance without essentially paying twice the amount after free tier ends. Maybe add another lambda function? I don't have any ideas. Any minute improvements are much appreciated. Thank you.\\n\n",

      "18756    Before I even start, I'll say that I was not 100% sure whether SO is the appropriate SX for this question. Let me know if I should ask this on some other SX.  \\nThe question is about FaaS in general, but if you can better explain this in a context of a particular FaaS platform/provider, that's great as well.  \\nI'm currently reading up on serverless computing (FaaS to be more specific) and trying to get myself somewhat comfortable with the subject. \\nNow almost everywhere I turn, I encounter the following statements about FaaS:\\n1) Most FaaS platforms support down-to-zero scaling;\\n2) FaaS providers charge their users based on their function execution time (usually measured in ms);\\n3) Potential cold starts (i.e., creating a new instance instead of reusing an existing one) are an issue in FaaS as they considerably degrade performance of your application;\\nPoints 1 and 2 are considered benefits - you get exactly what you need (including nothing at all, if applicable) andy pay for exactly what you get.\\nPoint 3 is considered a drawback - the request takes considerably more time to complete. I've seen authors describing cold starts as a sign of FaaS platforms not yet being mature. I've seen practitioners saying that they set up periodic requests just to keep their functions from becoming inactive and \"going under\" thus triggering the cold start the next time it's called.\\nMy question is - why are cold starts viewed as undesirable instead of as a trade-off?\\nWhat I mean is, considering that the user pays for execution time in FaaS, wouldn't it usually be in their best interests to avoid having warm, but idle function instances? To me it seems like a cost vs high availibility decision. Do I misunderstand something? Does having a warm, but idle function instance does not count towards one's execution time? Even if so:\\na) isn't it undesirable from the providers' perspective (having to allocate resources that are neither used nor paid for)?\\nb) sending periodic requests (as mentioned above) surely does cost you, right?\\n\n",

FaaS jvm is going to be shut down after serving it's call, so You either keep it running (like regular server) and pay for literally every millisecond or some calls may be delayed even few seconds (to boot everything up).\\nI have found two projects, that are trying to use Spring in FaaS environment and are tackling this problem, but in my option it's easier to remove problem (reflections) that try to overcome it with hacks.\\n\\n\\nOr, maybe there is another way to solve this problem and efficiently use Spring in FaaS, that I am not aware of?\\nRelated question: \\nI have been trying to use minimal Spring Framework application (like 3-5 classes) and still it takes (sometimes) 5-15 seconds to handle first request (next are handled in 50-100ms), so minimizing isn't really working in this case.\\n\n",

Static website available after login - easily build and running on nginx.\\nBut it seems to me cumbersome to server static web with small amount of connections (few per day) and spent a hours to set properly and maintain virtual machine during the lifespan of this project.\\nI use mostly GCP and consider their load balancer, or buckets made for static content, but none of this is able to give you a chance to auth users with passwords.\\nDo you have any tip for this? Provider is not concern or some kind of serverless with a pay as go will be perfect in my situation.\\nThank you for your time\\n\n",

I am unsure why this is happening and would like some more information.\\nHere is the stack trace:\\n\\nMy source code can be found here: \\nYes I know running Spring Boot on a lambda is dumb, but it is temporary. So, I don't have to pay for an EC2 instance. This is also not refined yet so I know there will be other things I should change.\\nEDIT: Here is the relevant code\\nThis first one is the lambda handler. I originally had the commented out code but switched to the other because the start time was substantially faster. Both methods give the same error.\\nThe second one is the class where the error is being encountered, which is my auth filter. I added the comment  to the second snippet so it is easier to see the exact location of where the exception is being thrown.\\n\\n\\nFor more context, my source code can be found here: \\n\n",

I mean, in S3 I would pay to put request and if I do it element by element this could be quite inefficient.\\nI also imagine that storing items in memory would not be a good idea either, so im not sure what should I use for the best result\\nOther question: when I developed locally i used ReceiveMessage but in Lambda function I have to use ReceiveMessageAsync, why this?\\n\n",

It also has to have backend logic as there are accounts, objects owned by users, and possible integration with a payment service.\\nWhat I initially expected from this, before knowning about serverless, is that you build a backend using something like Go (was my case), where you handle all the database data and third-party integrations, build a front end with something like Vue, and then use the backend's REST API to communicate between both of them.\\nIs this still the case with serverless? Do you build the whole backend server code, or does it work in another way?\\nI don't need/want you to explain all of it to me. I just need some insight on what is done and common so I can investigate further.\\n\n",

This server's job is to process Stripe payments. I am trying to get my React SPA to submit the Stripe checkout from the client, but am receiving a CORS error when I try to submit. \\nHow can I avoid this CORS error? I would imagine I need to either publish both client and AWS server on the same TLD (not sure how to make that work), or I'd need to disable CORS on the server (but that seems insecure).\\nStripe server call:\\n\\nForm submission\\n\\n\n",

The idea is that if an organisations last pay day has passed, I want to fetch the payment status from an external API using a Lambda function. If the pay day has not passed, I do not want to invoke the function but simply return a \"OK\".\\nIs there any way I can conditionally invoke a Lambda function? Something like this:\\n\\nIf I run this, Appsync complains about  attribute missing when the condition is not met. I have also noted that the  attribute which exists for queries is not available for Lambda datasources.\\nThank you in advance &lt;3\\n\n",

Information needed are email and domain name.\\nPayment are managed by stripe and I use Lambda and API gateway to verify payment information.\\nIf payment is successful, I'm sending email and domain name to SQS.\\nWhat I've got\\nThe data is not sent to SQS right after the validation.\\nI don't know why but the first use of the form, nothing is set to SQS ; \\nthe second time the form is used, data form the first form are send to SQS ; the third time the form is used, it's data of the second form they are send to SQS, etc...\\nCant' find the problem on the lambda code\\n\\nIf someone, can explain me what's wrong. Thanks :)\\n\n",

I can create \"serverless REST API\" with Azure Functions, but what about HTML, JS, CSS for web site, database, etc. ?\\nI tried Azure App Service, but it lacks \"pay only for what you use\" option, as all plans have Monthly payments, as well as Azure SQL for database. And App Service doesn't seem to be constructed to host serverless-architecture web sites, more for classic ASP.NET web sites that you can easily deploy there.\\nAlso, there is popular library  and they even mentioned Azure: \"using AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google CloudFunctions &amp; more\", but there is no a single example how to use it for Azure and all Docs are for Amazon AWS.\\nThanks!\\n\n",

I've read that using Amazon S3, Lambda and DynamoDB is a way to set this up, by hosting the front-end on S3, using Lambda functions to access the back-end, and storing data in DynamoDB. I'll need to run a script on page load to get data to display, save user profiles/allow logins, and acccept payments using Stripe or Braintree. \\nIs this a good situation to use this setup, or am I better off just using EC2 with a LAMP stack? Which is better in terms of cost?\\n\n",

      "17967    I'm developing an ecommerce website.\\nIt's for a \"ground-based\" clothing store that is used to sells only via third party platform.\\n And now want a own website.\\nI started with Wordpress+Woocommerce.\\nThen i tried a ZeitNow+Next+Graphql+React version.\\nIt connects itself to Wordpress+Woocomerce database via GraphQL Queries.\\nIt uses ZeitNow to avoid implementing a real Node+Express server on my machine.\\nWhich path to choose to complete the website and publish it ?

I have tried to use AWS Lambda and Alexa skill kit but a bit confused about how to integrate them in Java hibernate.

Before I started I tried to learn how to model nosql databases since its really different to our known relational databases. I learned that I have to stick on the  model. Im using DynamoDB Streams to aggregate some data, for instance the customer count for a product (there are some more complex cases than that). Since I have only one single table, my lambda function writes in the same table, from which the stream came. . If I understand it right, this scenario could lead to an infinite loop since the first insert trigger triggers an update trigger. This is something im escaping in my lambda function. My question now is Am I  getting billed for two lambda functions and two DynamoDb streams each time I make an insert in my db? \\nIf yes should I ignore the best practise way of a nosql db and split the table into multiple or should I invest the money ? Because I am doubling my bill in this case. What are the cons of splitting my table in multiple tables ? Would be the effect of the cons that big ?\\n\n",
      "1686     One of the scary things about being a small fish in the AWS ocean is what seems to be unlimited liability in the unlikely event of a flood of transactions on a publicly exposed service. AWS is designed for the big guys, for whom availability is the be-all and end-all. There's a great deal of effort in keeping services up, but apparently none when it comes to saving us from astronomical bills. Amazon seems to have been repeatedly asked for a spending cap, but AFAIK, the best they've come up with is billing alerts. I've read some horror stories, like the guy who set up a small website for family and friends and got a bill for $10,000. The best Amazon has done is provide billing alerts, and what if you are AFK? Quite large sums could disappear before you can shut down.\\nSo, my cunning plan - to write a Lambda fired from a billing threshold event which raises the drawbridge and shuts down any public facing facilities.\\nSo, I started with CloudFront and that's quite do-able, though disabling a distribution take some time to propagate.\\nNow we come to my first technical quandary. I thought I could just check all the buckets for public permissions and revoke them. But, since I last looked in detail at S3, there's this static website setting. So, how do I, programmatically, turn this off? Obviously I don't want to delete the bucket. To my surprise turning this on does not create a public permission in the ACL. There's a service in the API to update properties on one of these static websites, but not to revoke it.\\nIt seems to be somewhat the same with the API gateway. You can delete an API, but not suspend it. And if you delete it, then re-building will probably give you a different hostname, which creates some hastle.\\nI'm trying to write a fairly generic Lambda and make it public domain.\\n\n",

I am on the free tier and I haven't used the work-in-progress functions for a couple of days, but today I realized in the cost overview that I have used about 9000 hours and will possibly use about 12000 at the end of the month. See here:\\n\\nSo was wondering why?\\nI know that you reserve the hourly capacity. And since none of the skills is live, I sticked with 5 RCU/WCU for each table (it says 25 RCU/WCU is okay for the free tier). But these numbers doesn't make sense? \\nOr do they? \\nAnd the question is what happens when I scale this down to 1 RCU/WCU when all the skills go live? \\nI know that this would mean that only one request per second can be processed, but I am sure that this would be enough for the skills (at least for the first couple of month) - I guess that I won't have more than 200-300 monthly users. Will this significantly reduce the above numbers? Or will I be charged huge bill for some reason I don't understand after going though the documentation?\\n\n",

We made sure that none of our S3 buckets are public so attacks should not be possible. I have no idea how we are getting so many requests as we only have about 20 active users of our app everyday. Assuming that each of them were to make about 10 GET requests to our API, which uses lambda and boto3 to download 10 files from S3 bucket to the lambda's tmp folders, then returns a value, it still wouldn't make sense for us to have about 3 millions GET requests a day.\\nWe also have another EventBridge triggered lambda, which uses Athena to query our database (S3), and will run every 2 hours. I don't know if this is a potential cause? Can anyone shed some light on this? And how we can take a better look into where and why are we getting so many GET requests? Thank you.\\n\n",

Cloudflare?)\\nGateway redirects request to cloud-function\\nCloud-function stores user authentication in DB\\nUser is now authenticated.\\nThe authenticated user can now request actual data, like profile, through other cloud-functions.\\nResponse with data to the user.\\n\\nIs this a correct understanding of how OAuth works? If so, does this make sense, or would a usual server be cheaper to handle OAuth?\\n\n",

The connection is not cheap and I certainly don't need it open the whole time. Probably just 10 minutes every day is enough. Is there a way to schedule connect/disconnect event of the VPN connection using Lambda function just like starting/stopping EC2 or RDS instance like below using Python's Boto3 library:\\n\\nAlthough Boto3 supports , it doesn't seem to have any methods that switch the connection on and off. Is there a way to control the connection?\\n\n",

User can have thousands of these tasks and can add/modify and delete them. When a user creates a task, django signals create a Celery periodic task which then is running periodically.\\nI'm searching for a more scalable solution using AWS. I've read about using Lambda + Cloudwatch Events. \\nMy question is: how do I approach this to let my users create tens of thousands of these tasks in the cheapest / most scalable way?\\nThank you for reading my question!\\nPeter\\n\n",

I want to have DynamoDB as the backend for storing data rather than having a simple markdown CMS. I want to know from the community here if this idea is reasonable and sounds good because I'm moderately experienced in AWS and so not fully firm about it and seek some help.\\nI will be developing the CMS in ASP.NET MVC Core served though Lambda. This CMS will have an external API which will be ASP.NET MVC Core Web API.\\nI also need some thoughts on the cost of running this CMS i.e. Do you think it will be cheaper to run as against the conventional CMS or if DynamoDB can squeeze a lot of juice!!!\\n\n",

On the Blob objects I want to create a lifecycle policy, like GFS, for the backups. Then I want to move older data (perhaps the yearly backup files) to colder storage automatically. Then I need to charge my client per GB storage and need a monthly report, maybe an e-mail, to our finance department with the month's maximum storage GB value. I will develop this and need guidance on where to start. Please point me in the right direction. As cheap and serverless as possible. I will answer my own question with the scripts etc to share the knowledge. Thanks!\\n\n",

To have them being served (both) by CloudFront, i created an Origin Group. The Origin Group is the origin for the behavior with higher precedence.\\nMy questions are:\\n1: Are there any fees for keeping content cached for more than the default 24h ? I assume not because it might be cheaper to store than to transfer data.\\n2: The origin access inside the group seems to always be the same, respecting the failover sequence (primary origin -&gt; secondary origin -&gt; ...). Is there any possibility to make the origin group be load balanced ? ie, actually pulling from the origin with the lowest latency inside the origin group ? I saw that i can use Lambda@Edge to change the domain for the request. How does that work with conjunction with Origin Groups and failover ? If i have a bucket A and a bucket B and they both form an Origin Group (A primary, B secondary) and i use the Lambda@Edge to route to B and the request fails, does it route back to A ? \\nThanks !\\n\n",

So I have added these Lambda functions to the same VPC which makes them lose internet access. \\nOne of the service I need access to is a SQS queue, which is not in the VPC as it doesn't support it.\\nI found two solutions to my problem:\\n\\nCreate a NAT gateway and allow my function to access the internet\\nCreate a VPC endpoint for SQS\\n\\nI wanted to go with the latter. When I did that, the Lambda worked fine, but I couldn't deploy new code to my Beanstalk instances. That should have nothing to do with it! I spent hours to realize Beanstalk uses SQS to send messages to my instances to perform the deploy.\\nQuestions:\\n\\nIs it a better solution to use a VPC endpoint rather than a NAT gateway? (it seems to be cheaper)\\nIf so, how can I keep my Beanstalk instances working correctly?\\n\\n\n",

I am using a NAT instance because it's about 10x cheaper than a NAT Gateway using the free tier. The downside is that unlike NAT Gateway, a NAT Instance needs actual maintenance, and I am unsure what type of maintenance it needs. I want to learn about things I need to do to keep my server running well and healthy.\\nWhat are things I can do to make sure of that?\\nHere is my AWS Architecture:\\nAll of the following is in my VPC. I have 1 subnet in ca-central-1a and 1 in ca-central-1b. In the route table, both subnets point to my NAT Instance. I have a 3rd subnet in ca-central-1b and in the route table it points to an internet gateway. My NAT Instance is in ca-central-1b.\\nMy NAT Instance security group NATSG has HTTP and HTTPS inbounds from both of my subnets in ca-central-1a and ca-central-1b and outbound to 0.0.0.0/0. Should I make another NAT Instance in ca-central-1a and make it only inbound from the subnet in ca-central-1a i.e 1 NAT Instance for each subnet? Would that be healthier/safer?\\nExtra information:\\nI disabled Source/dest check. Was that a good idea?\\nFor my AMI I chose a recent community AMI amzn-ami-vpc-nat and I created an Auto Scale Group which has my NAT instance. It only has 1 instance, is there any point of the Auto Scale Group if there's only 1 instance in it? I am not sure that I am using the Auto Scale Group right, I simply created it but haven't configured anything.\\n\n",

I've some video processing work to do, for which I'm gonna use FFMPEG. And it can take from 1 minute to 20 minutes to do work.\\nso my questions are: \\n\\nare CFs good fit for this. I don't want my main server to do these\\ntasks.\\ncan i make CF to only time out after say 60 minutes, or before if finished.\\nIs it going to be cheaper than just using server instead. \\n\\nFrom what I know it's perfect scenario to use cloud functions. Alternative is to use build queue, wait for available processes to finish and then when time comes finish task.\\n\n",
      "15590    I have a program that performs several thousand monte-carlo simulations to predict a result; I can't say what they really predict, so I'm going to use another example from \"the indisputable existence of santa claus\", since the content of those algorithms are not relevant to the question.  I want to know how often each square on a Monopoly board is visited (to predict which the best properties to buy are).  To do this, I simulate thousands of games and collate the results.  My current implementation is a stand-alone C# application but I want to move it to the cloud so that I can provide this as a service - each user can get personalised results by submitting the number of sides that each of their dice have.\\nThe current implementation is also quite slow - it is very parallisable since each simulation is entirely independent but I only have 8 cores, so it takes upwards of 20 minutes to complete the full prediction with about 50000 individual simulations on my local machine.\\nThe plan is to have AWS lambda functions each run one (or several) simulations and then collate - basically mapreduce it.  I looked in to using AWS EMR (Elastic MapReduce) but that is way too large-scale for what I want, spinning up the instances to run the computations alone seems to take longer than the whole calculation alone (which would not matter for multi-hour offline analyses, but I want low-latency to respond over a web request).\\nThe ideal as I see it would be:\\nLambda 0 - Fires off many other lambda functions, each doing a small part of the calculation.\\nLambda 1..N - Do many simulations in parallel (the number is not a constant).\\nLambda N+1 - Collate all the results and return the answer.\\nThere is a lambda mapreduce framework here:\\n\\nBut it seems to have one major drawback - each time a map stage completes, it writes its results to S3 (I'm fine with using that as a temporary) then triggers a new lambda via an event.  That triggered lambda looks to see if all the results have been written to storage yet.  If not, it ends, if yes it does the reduction step.  That seems like a fair solution, but I'm just slightly concerned about a) race-hazards when two results come in together, could two reducers both compute the results?  And b) that seems like it is firing off a lot of lambdas that all just decide not to run (I know they're cheap to run, but doubling the number to two per simulation - calculate and maybe reduce - will obviously double the costs).  Is there a way to fire off an S3 result after, say, 100 files are written to a folder instead of after every one?\\nI looked at using step functions, but I'm not sure how to fire many lambdas in parallel in one step and have them all return before the state machine transitions.  Step functions would however be useful for the final wrinkle - I want to hide all this behind an API.\\nFrom what I've read, APIs can fire off a lambda and return the result of that lambda, but I don't want the invoked lambda to be the one returning the result.  It isn't when you instead invoke a step function from the API, the results of the last state are returned by the API call instead.\\nIn short, I want:\\nAPI request -&gt; Calculate results in parallel -&gt; API response\\nIt is that bit in the middle I'm not clear how to do, while being able to return all the results as a response to the original request - either on their own are easy.\\nA few options I can see:\\nUse a step function, which is natively supported by the AWS API gateway now, and invoke multiple lambdas in one state, waiting for them all to return before transitioning.\\nUse AWS EMR, but somehow keep the provisioned instances always live to avoid the provisioning time overheads.  This obviously negates the scalability of Lambda and is more expensive.\\nUse the mapreduce framework, or something similar, and find a way to respond to an incoming request from a different lambda to the one that was initially invoked by the API request.  Ideally also reduce the number of S3 events involved here, but that's not a priority.\\nRespond instantly to the original API request from the first lambda, then push more data to the user later when the calculations finish (they should only take about 30 seconds with the parallelism, and the domain is such that that is an acceptable time to wait for a response, even an HTTP response).\\nI doubt it will make any difference to the solution, since it is just an expansion of the middle bit, not a fundamental change, but the real calculation is iterative, so would be:\\nRequest -&gt; Mapreduce -&gt; Mapreduce -&gt; ... -&gt; Response\\nAs long as I know how to chain one set of lambda functions within a request, chaining more should be just more of the same (I hope).\\nThank you.\\nP.S.  I can't create them, and neither the tags  nor  exist yet.\\n\n",

One thing that they all need to do is access an foreign ID key mapping.  That is, they all are passed a certain type of ID, but need to included the \"name\" field associated with that ID in their responses.  Basically, just a key/value store.\\nI could build a separate microservice to manage these mappings (and maybe still will), but that also needs the simple database.\\nMy services don't usually get a huge amount of throughput, but I need them to be performant.\\nI'd like to keep it cheap, and I'd like it to be as low maintenance as possible.\\nBasically, I'd like something \"Serverless\" (i.e. doesn't require an ongoing EC2 instance or RDS instance running), fast, and straightforward to access.\\nI've thought about just having each \"key\" be an S3 key, with the value being the object, but that's not super performant when I need to access a bunch at a time. (should I look into redshift spectrum? is that way overkill?  does it matter if is?)\\nI know AWS used to offer simpledb, which is probably basically what I'm after.  So what would be closest now?\\nThanks for your advice!\\n\n",
