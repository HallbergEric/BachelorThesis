      "3673     * APOLOGIES for the IMAGES Posted *  I am looking for potential cost cutting measures for an application that is hosted on AWS with the following configuration / setup   EC2 Instances Java Dynamic Web Application with Web Server  App Server RDS - MySQL  The application is used 95% of the time for 1 week in a month  and the remaining time 5% distributed over the remaining 3 weeks  For the sake of cost cutting so as to not pay for the EC2 instances  we are looking to go serverless  My Background w r t  Cloud / AWS:  No Previous Professional Working Knowledge in any Cloud Based System except for EC2 where I was managing a Java Web Application with a similar setup as above  I have only been searching online and reading a lot of websites / blogs   I have prepared a presentation based on the materials I have read online  But I need expert opinion / confirmation that the solution options in the presentation are   Possible to Implement Not Too Complex to implement compared to the EC2 Implementation  Potentially saves money as a generic case  compared to renting EC2 instances  The presentations slides are as below:                I am not limiting to AWS  but since current application is hosted on AWS would like to use the same platform  But if similar implementations are possible using Azure or other platforms  we are open  All that we are looking for is to cut costs  I may be missing to provide some important information for you to help advice me  Please let me know what you need and I will get it for you  Thanks  Regards \n",

      "15670    The thing what i want do: Im thinking about use aws dynamodb as my new web site(press and bbs mixed type) main server  But I cant design database  because dynamodb maybe cannot satisfy my requirements  Somebody knows how can i do  Foundation My bosss plan is spawning many websites and close it several days after if its traffic is low  (and go on until it success) He has many domain names (over hundreads) and want make many websites  And he also wants selling our system for web solution to customers  ( internet newspaper  blogs  magazines  etc    ) It is very large plan  anyway i must design the system    Situation first  most of website is going trashcan after several days  so make each websites on on-premise server is not good way because it means too much manual-jobs  (just deploying the site  undeploying the site) And also on-premised pricing is not good in this case because we cant predict any webserver is closing (because traffic size lower than survive-line)  or survive because traffic is grow faster  i guess 80% of sites are just ghost sites    second  the amount of spawining websites are not measurable  Because my boss always yelled me as many as can    And I also consider about this project is abandoned by my company after launching some month after  (maybe they want keep-and-not-maintain mode with not consume many price)    Anyway  ths problem is the    1  cant predict how many sites are alive and gets high traffic  2  cant predict how many sites are ghosts or few traffics (under 1000users/days)  3  even the project is abandoned  thell want keep-and-not-maintain-mode (with lowcost as they can) conslusion is 1  most sites are going to keep-and-not-maintain-mode  its cost must low 2  some few sites are burst in after times  it must support this situation also    So next is my answer: Server : full faas serverless with stateless server (lambda  cloudrun  function  etc    i think cloudrun is best because development is very it can easy using my own docker) the reason is    if this website is just keep and not maintain it  we did not pay for it  or very small price  if the site growing up or traffic is burst  it can support on-live    Database : serverless because its traffic is not measurable in this stage  there only two serverless (means needs no pay for provisioned instance)  Aurora and Dynamodb    Aurora is my first choice because I always using mysql or mariadb in webservice  But there is two problem  Aurora serverless is too sensitive acu scaling  and it never going scale-down until 5 minutes flowed  (and if it scaled up to 4 acu  5*4=20acu/min  just one connection and query once  but pricing=$0 03) It is pretty sure if one of these sites traffic is changed from nobody use it to a few people comes  Autoscale price is going to very higher  even i set max acu scale limit to 1  there are another problems  (well-known problems)  If aurora start from cold  it takes very long time(about 30seconds)  And if it is scaling  it also takes some delay  Anyway  i cant make good pricing design for Aurora    So I moved on Dynamodb  It has very good pricing rules  In on-demand mode  under $2 per 1 000 000 rcu  I guess most of site data is stored in S3  So read/write other data is not much than 1kb/4kb  and even i transaction for each unit  under $2 per 500 000rcu    Actual Problem But it has trap point  If I do scan  its pricing is going to very higher  because returns a lot of data (until 1mb)  I accepted  So I must using query  But query is working same as scan in a partition  And pricing is going to scanned amount of read-write-units(until 1mb)  So if I have 100 items in a key and query just one item (total 100 members and just select one of that members)  the dynamodb charges 100 times pricing because it scanned 100 items  (assume each item lower than 1kb)  I cant believe it  (x100 pricing) so googled it  I found many people are design dynamodb seperated hash-key  (like members-startfrom-a  members-startfrom-b      ) Question Is it normal  In this time  I think dynamodb cannot support normal website (bbs or press  or blog)  because they are rdb optimized structures  Even paging articles needs full-scan(or partitioned full-scan)   Is it right  or there is a migration rules for rdb user to dynamodb user  Someone can show me case-study  Most case people use dynamodb as subdb    \n",

      "1749    Ive got the order microservice thats written as go AWS lambda function  The main function named order-service bound to API Gateway  It receives several parameters like  of int  creates an order with artifacts and returns serialized order with order_id and total price  This function invokes a function named order-item which creates an order-item and returns them in parallel(per product)  These functions invoke product and user functions to retrieve information about user and products by their ids   Then  the order function invokes another lambda called fee-function which takes just total price and user id and gives back fee price  Of course  it calls some other function like user function and so on  Basically  this is a simple example of how the service works in general  Any function calls some others like user-discount  state taxes etc  The questions are:  Is it good that order function invokes fee function through Amazon  but it can just import fee handler package and run it inside itself (However  fee function may be called from outside so it must be deployed as a separate function as well) Is it good that each function receives just user id and loads the user invoking user function  Perhaps  better to preload it and pass it through everywhere  Something else  Is it good that one function calls other functions and they call some others and so on  is there any better approach in my situation  Use SNS  Step function  dependency injections/aws layers   The main reason why I asked is to withstand thousands of RPM and not pay a lot  Thanks for helping  I appreciate this   \n",

      "8636     Im trying to understand the various steps and requirements I need to go through in order to make our website available from China  both on the regulation side (Great Firewall) but also on the technical side (technical limitations and changes to perform) for  Right now  it doesnt seem to be allowed:   I dont need nor want to own a  ch website  I just want to make my website available for Chinese at   Also  the website is currently hosted on AWS Lambda (using the Serverless framework)  and only deployed in the eu-west-1 region (Ireland) only  The website doesnt sell anything online: Its an information website  not e-commerce   Ive looked into this issue for a few hours  but Im a bit lost regarding the exact steps needed to make it happen  Here are a few questions I havent found answers for:  Does deploying the lambda to  (China Beijing) is a requirement or can Chinese users access my  lambda if I get an ICP license   Regardless of the deploying region  I seem to need an ICP License  as the AWS FAQ says at :  Q: Do I need to file for ICP Recordal or ICP License if I want to host public content on AWS China (Beijing) Region or AWS China (Ningxia) Region  Yes  In accordance with Chinese laws and regulations  if you use either AWS China Region to host a website providing non-commercial internet information services  you must undertake filing procedures for a non-commercial website (“ICP Recordal”) through the relevant government authority  If you use either AWS China Region to host a website providing commercial internet information services  you must obtain a value-added telecommunications license for a commercial website (“ICP License”) from the relevant government authority  You may be required to produce your ICP Recordal or ICP License  as applicable  before you host public content using one of the AWS China Regions  AWS China (Beijing) Region is operated by Sinnet  who is responsible for content hosted in the Beijing Region  while AWS China (Ningxia) Region is operated by NWCD  who is responsible for content hosted in the Ningxia Region  Both Sinnet and NWCD provide support at no additional charge for customers seeking ICP related services  though customers are responsible for any fees imposed by the applicable government authorities  To learn more about the filing procedures  please visit Sinnet at  and NWCD at    As for actually getting the license  its a bit out of topic here  but I couldnt understand the first provider workflow:   website is a mix of english and chinese and I got lost in translation (even when using their english website version)  seems to require to send an email to support@amazonaws com cn  no idea what happens next  Anyway  the process seems to take around 4-6 weeks  So  it likely takes even more time than that   Regarding the technical details now  it seems like the China region ( Beijing and  Ningxia) behave in a very particular way on AWS Lambda   They only support  endpoints They do not support native Serverless  variables  See     Also  there are technical impacts on the website itself:  Google services are banned  or limited (Google Analytics (limited)  Google Tag Manager  Google Fonts (banned)) and must be changed  converted to owned CDN  etc   And Ive probably missed other technical limitations  since thats just those I learned about within 2h of digging around  Are there other steps I overlooked  (regulation or technical) Do you have any advices or feedback about how to make a website hosted on AWS Lambda available in China  \n",

      "14512    I have an AWS Lambda function written in python that is starting to get a bit too big  It often runs over the AWS Lambda limit of 15 minutes   The function is responsible for making loads of API calls  and unfortunately I have not taken the time to make them all async yet  The workflow for the function looks something roughly like this:  Receive data for xxx clients (1 api call) Place API call for each client and wait for response (xxx api calls) Based on #2 API call response  place yet another API call for each client and wait for response (xxx api calls) Store response from #3 in DynamoDB (xxx DB updates)  Initially my plan was to just keep everything in 1 lambda function  and modify my code such that all API calls run async  and to do one big dynamoDB batch update at the end  However  it occurs to me that theoretically this function could still grow too large in the future  if we start needing to run it for enormous numbers of clients  Additionally  in my opinion  managing all those python async calls can be a bit cumbersome in specific situations  My second approach  is to chain together lambda functions  That is  create a second lambda function  lets name it order_for_single_client  which perform steps #2-4 for just one client  The top level lambda function will gather data on all clients  and for each one  make a separate lambda call to order_for_single_client  So  if we need to order for 500 clients  the top level function will just make 500 separate lambda calls  Naturally  all the async behavior should take care of itself on the end of AWS since it will run the lambda functions in parallel  (with the exception of the batch dynamoDB update we wanted  but we can worry about that later)   What is the preferred way of handling this situation from an architecture perspective  Splitting things up into a lambda chain  or trying to speed things up using async inside a single lambda function  If we were to implement the lambda chain  will it be more or less expensive to run at scale compared to the single function async approach  Is there a third design solution to this problem that I have not considered  (Apart from spinning up an EC2 instance  which I would prefer not to do)   \n",

      "15670    The thing what i want do: Im thinking about use aws dynamodb as my new web site(press and bbs mixed type) main server  But I cant design database  because dynamodb maybe cannot satisfy my requirements  Somebody knows how can i do  Foundation My bosss plan is spawning many websites and close it several days after if its traffic is low  (and go on until it success) He has many domain names (over hundreads) and want make many websites  And he also wants selling our system for web solution to customers  ( internet newspaper  blogs  magazines  etc    ) It is very large plan  anyway i must design the system    Situation first  most of website is going trashcan after several days  so make each websites on on-premise server is not good way because it means too much manual-jobs  (just deploying the site  undeploying the site) And also on-premised pricing is not good in this case because we cant predict any webserver is closing (because traffic size lower than survive-line)  or survive because traffic is grow faster  i guess 80% of sites are just ghost sites    second  the amount of spawining websites are not measurable  Because my boss always yelled me as many as can    And I also consider about this project is abandoned by my company after launching some month after  (maybe they want keep-and-not-maintain mode with not consume many price)    Anyway  ths problem is the    1  cant predict how many sites are alive and gets high traffic  2  cant predict how many sites are ghosts or few traffics (under 1000users/days)  3  even the project is abandoned  thell want keep-and-not-maintain-mode (with lowcost as they can) conslusion is 1  most sites are going to keep-and-not-maintain-mode  its cost must low 2  some few sites are burst in after times  it must support this situation also    So next is my answer: Server : full faas serverless with stateless server (lambda  cloudrun  function  etc    i think cloudrun is best because development is very it can easy using my own docker) the reason is    if this website is just keep and not maintain it  we did not pay for it  or very small price  if the site growing up or traffic is burst  it can support on-live    Database : serverless because its traffic is not measurable in this stage  there only two serverless (means needs no pay for provisioned instance)  Aurora and Dynamodb    Aurora is my first choice because I always using mysql or mariadb in webservice  But there is two problem  Aurora serverless is too sensitive acu scaling  and it never going scale-down until 5 minutes flowed  (and if it scaled up to 4 acu  5*4=20acu/min  just one connection and query once  but pricing=$0 03) It is pretty sure if one of these sites traffic is changed from nobody use it to a few people comes  Autoscale price is going to very higher  even i set max acu scale limit to 1  there are another problems  (well-known problems)  If aurora start from cold  it takes very long time(about 30seconds)  And if it is scaling  it also takes some delay  Anyway  i cant make good pricing design for Aurora    So I moved on Dynamodb  It has very good pricing rules  In on-demand mode  under $2 per 1 000 000 rcu  I guess most of site data is stored in S3  So read/write other data is not much than 1kb/4kb  and even i transaction for each unit  under $2 per 500 000rcu    Actual Problem But it has trap point  If I do scan  its pricing is going to very higher  because returns a lot of data (until 1mb)  I accepted  So I must using query  But query is working same as scan in a partition  And pricing is going to scanned amount of read-write-units(until 1mb)  So if I have 100 items in a key and query just one item (total 100 members and just select one of that members)  the dynamodb charges 100 times pricing because it scanned 100 items  (assume each item lower than 1kb)  I cant believe it  (x100 pricing) so googled it  I found many people are design dynamodb seperated hash-key  (like members-startfrom-a  members-startfrom-b      ) Question Is it normal  In this time  I think dynamodb cannot support normal website (bbs or press  or blog)  because they are rdb optimized structures  Even paging articles needs full-scan(or partitioned full-scan)   Is it right  or there is a migration rules for rdb user to dynamodb user  Someone can show me case-study  Most case people use dynamodb as subdb    \n",

      "14871    I have the following use case scenario for which I am considering aws services to see how I can come up with a scalable solution  Thanks in advance for your help  Scenario:  Users can sign up to an application(which is named say Lets Remind or something else) using their email and phone   The app does one thing that is to send email and sms alerts to user  User can create n number of tasks for which he wants to be reminded  For instance he can set up a  monthly reminder for paying card dues  Currently the value of n is from 5 to 10 per user  The notifications are flexible meaning it can be daily  weekly  monthly  bi-weekly  User can also  specify the start date of a notification  The end date is the date when the event is due (for instance  the day the card payment is due)  Once this date is expired the notification is rendered inactive for  the current month   For weekly daily bi-weekly notifications  the notifications are deleted once the event date is passed   These are not recurring in nature  For monthly recurring events such as payment of apartment rent etc  notification itself is not  deleted but rendered inactive after the event due date  Once the next event cycle (typically next  month billing cycle for payments use case) starts  the notification comes back to life and starts all  over again  Use can delete any event anytime he wants  If an event is deleted  the notifications for that event  will be deleted as well  First of all  I hope the use case is clear  Now heres my thoughts so far about solving this use case - 1) Use SNS since I need to send email and sms both  SES only supports emails  2) When a user registers for the app  create 2 subscriptions(one for his email and one for his sms endpoint) and also create a topic for the user(maybe a dynamically generated random userid) 3) Once user creates an event (e g  reminder for monthly apartment rental)  store the event data such as userid  startdate  duedate  frequency  isactive in a dynamodb table  4) Create a lambda function that will wake up when an entry is written to the dynamodb table (step 3); it will do the following - i) it will read the event data from the dynamodb table ii) determine the next date of the notification to be sent based on the current date and event  data iii) For active events (check isActive column of the dynamodb record) create a scheduled cron  expression rule based on ii above in cloudwatch events and add the  target as the users topic (created in step 2 above)  For now  the notification message is  static  I have some doubts/queries about step iii - Is it possible to create cloudwatch event cron rule dynamically and add the users topic as target dynamically as I described  Or is it better to trigger a second lambda function dedicated for sending messages to the users topic using SNS notification  Which approach will be better for this use case  If user base grows large  is it recommended to create one topic per user  Am I on the right track with my approach above in general from a scalability point of view  If not  can anyone suggest any better idea for implementing this use case  Thanks in advance  \n",

      "1686     One of the scary things about being a small fish in the AWS ocean is what seems to be unlimited liability in the unlikely event of a flood of transactions on a publicly exposed service  AWS is designed for the big guys  for whom availability is the be-all and end-all  Theres a great deal of effort in keeping services up  but apparently none when it comes to saving us from astronomical bills  Amazon seems to have been repeatedly asked for a spending cap  but AFAIK  the best theyve come up with is billing alerts  Ive read some horror stories  like the guy who set up a small website for family and friends and got a bill for $10 000  The best Amazon has done is provide billing alerts  and what if you are AFK  Quite large sums could disappear before you can shut down  So  my cunning plan - to write a Lambda fired from a billing threshold event which raises the drawbridge and shuts down any public facing facilities  So  I started with CloudFront and thats quite do-able  though disabling a distribution take some time to propagate  Now we come to my first technical quandary  I thought I could just check all the buckets for public permissions and revoke them  But  since I last looked in detail at S3  theres this static website setting  So  how do I  programmatically  turn this off  Obviously I dont want to delete the bucket  To my surprise turning this on does not create a public permission in the ACL  Theres a service in the API to update properties on one of these static websites  but not to revoke it  It seems to be somewhat the same with the API gateway  You can delete an API  but not suspend it  And if you delete it  then re-building will probably give you a different hostname  which creates some hastle  Im trying to write a fairly generic Lambda and make it public domain  \n",
